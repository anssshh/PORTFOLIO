# Data Analytics Portfolio

I am a Computer Science student at IPB University with a growing focus on data analysis and a developing skillset in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. My experience includes:

- Participating in data science competitions like Satria Data, where I've gained hands-on experience analyzing datasets and building predictive models for text classification tasks.
- Working with substantial datasets, including a numeric dataset of 416,473 rows where I achieved over 70% accuracy.
- Exploring various NLP techniques using models like IndoBERT and other BERT variants.
- Applying both deep learning algorithms and classical machine learning methods like SVM, KNN, and clustering for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
- Developing proficiency in Python as my primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning projects.
- Practical experience with R, SQL, Excel, and Tableau for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- Building a foundation in data analytics techniques including report writing, data mining, data merging, statistical analysis, and critical thinking.
- Currently learning about reinforcement learning and its potential applications in personalized learning systems.

## A Model to Classify Tweets About Presidential Elections into Asta Gatra Classes
- Utilized linear regression method to understand the relationship between flood and education in Jakarta in 2020 - 2021
- Conducted a conclusion that there is no significant relationship between flood levels and education levels.
-   Recommended strengthening educational initiatives to enhance environmental awareness, as higher education levels may influence future relationships between education and environment issue
## A Forecasting Model Designed to Categorize Traffic Types Within Networks

## Logistic Regression for Fraud Detection in Financial Loan Payments

## Analysis of Flood and Education Level Relationship in DKI Jakarta
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict flood occurrences and their economic impact in Jakarta, Indonesia. Using historical data on rainfall patterns, urbanization metrics, and economic indicators, I create a robust predictive framework to Forecast flood likelihood and severity
My analysis combines time series forecasting, geospatial data, and educational statistic  to provide actionable insights for city planners and policymakers. This project aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers and education authorities. By understanding the role of education in disaster resilience, we can propose targeted educational programs and awareness campaigns to improve Jakarta's overall flood preparedness and response capabilities.
Key aspects of the project include:

- Data integration: Merging flood occurrence data with educational attainment statistics and socioeconomic indicators across Jakarta's districts.
- Correlation analysis: Examining the relationship between education levels and various flood impact metrics (e.g., damage costs, evacuation rates, recovery time).
- Predictive modeling: Developing machine learning models to forecast flood resilience based on educational and demographic factors.
- Policy implications: Identifying potential interventions in education that could enhance community flood resilience.
- Comparative analysis: Assessing how different levels of education (primary, secondary, tertiary) correlate with specific aspects of flood preparedness and response.


# The 
My involvement in data science competitions has provided me with essential knowledge and hands-on experience that are equipping me for a career in data analysis. This includes the ability to:  
- Clean and structure data  
- Identify patterns and insights  
- Formulate significant conclusions  
- Effectively convey important findings.  

Through this program, I'm improving my skills with Python's data analysis utilizing tools like 
- Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib),
- PyTorch (AdamW optimizer and TensorDataset),
- scikit-learn, and
- Indonesian-specific NLP tools (Sastrawi, fuzzywuzzy, python-Levenshtein, indonlp) while building a portfolio of projects.

My evolving skill set covers aspects of machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and traditional data analysis techniques, allowing me to approach data science problems from multiple perspectives as I continue to learn and grow in the field.
