# Data Analytics Portfolio

I am a Computer Science student at IPB University with a growing focus on data analysis and a developing skillset in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. My experience includes:

- Participating in data science competitions like Satria Data, where I've gained hands-on experience analyzing datasets and building predictive models for text classification tasks.
- Working with substantial datasets, including a numeric dataset of 416,473 rows where I achieved over 70% accuracy.
- Exploring various NLP techniques using models like IndoBERT and other BERT variants.
- Applying both deep learning algorithms and classical machine learning methods like SVM, KNN, and clustering for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
- Developing proficiency in Python as my primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning projects.
- Practical experience with R, SQL, Excel, and Tableau for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- Building a foundation in data analytics techniques including report writing, data mining, data merging, statistical analysis, and critical thinking.
- Currently learning about reinforcement learning and its potential applications in personalized learning systems.

My involvement in data science competitions has provided me with essential knowledge and hands-on experience that are equipping me for a career in data analysis. This includes the ability to:  
- Clean and structure data  
- Identify patterns and insights  
- Formulate significant conclusions  
- Effectively convey important findings.  

Through this program, I'm improving my skills with Python's data analysis utilizing tools like 
- Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib),
- PyTorch (AdamW optimizer and TensorDataset),
- scikit-learn, and
- Indonesian-specific NLP tools (Sastrawi, fuzzywuzzy, python-Levenshtein, indonlp) while building a portfolio of projects.

My evolving skill set covers aspects of machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and traditional data analysis techniques, allowing me to approach data science problems from multiple perspectives as I continue to learn and grow in the field.
