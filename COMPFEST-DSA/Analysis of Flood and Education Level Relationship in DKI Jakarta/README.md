- The resulting regression equation is: Y = 2.707103 + 0.000254X1 - 0.000081X2. we can conclude that x2 that refers to educational statistic doesnt give significant impact
- The multiple correlation value is 0.54, indicating a moderate relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
- The contribution of multiple correlation is 29.30%, which means that the independent variable explains 29.30% of the variation in the dependent variable.
- The calculated F value is 2.07146293, used to test the significance of the regression model.
- The F table value is 3.49 at a significance level of 0.95 with degrees of freedom (2, 20).
- F count < F table, then H0 is accepted and Ha is rejected, so it is concluded that the level of education has no effect on the flood level.

## Build The Model
The model uses 80% of the data from the dataset for training. MSE is used to evaluate the model. The resulting value is 1.936289620456332 which indicates if the model is good enough to predict the flood level with the level of education

# Conslusion
Although the conclusion of the analysis that has been done is that there is no relationship between flood level and education level, education must still be intensified because it does not rule out the possibility that there are situations where there is a relationship between education levels and flood levels. A high level of education indicates a high education index and a high education index means a high quality of education. High quality of education. A high quality of education helps build a person's awareness of environmental awareness.
